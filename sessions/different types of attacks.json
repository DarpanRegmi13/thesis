However, I can expand on the categories and provide examples to reach a total of 20 attack types, keeping in mind some will be variations on a theme.\n\nHere are 20 types of cyberattacks, categorized for clarity:\n\n\n1. Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:\n1.1. UDP Flood\n1.2. SYN Flood\n1.3. ICMP Flood\n1.4. HTTP Flood\n\n\n2. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks:\n2.1. DNS Amplification DDoS\n2.2. Botnet-based DDoS\n\n\n3. Malware Attacks:\n3.1. Viruses\n3.2. Worms\n3.3. Trojans\n3.4. Ransomware\n3.5. Spyware\n3.6. Adware\n\n\n4. Data Breach Attacks:\n4.1. SQL Injection\n4.2. Phishing\n4.3.

Session Hijacking\n\n\nThis list isn't exhaustive, and many attacks can overlap or combine elements. For example, ransomware can be delivered via phishing or exploit kits.\n\nTo help me provide more specific information or incident response guidance, please tell me:\n\n\ud83d\udd39 What specific type of attack are you concerned about? Knowing this will allow me to provide more tailored advice.\n\ud83d\udd39 What is your current situation? Have you experienced an attack? Are you trying to prevent one?\n\ud83d\udd39 What systems are involved? (e.g., individual computer, network, server)\n\nThe more details you can provide, the better I can assist you."
