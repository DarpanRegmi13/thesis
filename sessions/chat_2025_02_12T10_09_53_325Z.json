XSS is a type of web security vulnerability where malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. This allows an attacker to execute code in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information. It's not directly covered in the provided context about sandboxing and browser separation. To help me understand how this relates to your incident, could you please provide more details? For example: 1. **What is the specific incident you are investigating?** (e.g., a suspected XSS attack, a compromised website, etc.) 2. **What evidence do you have so far?** (e.g., error logs, network traffic captures, user reports) 3. **What is your current hypothesis about the attack?** 4. **What is your current objective?** (e.g., containment, eradication, investigation) With more information, I can provide more specific and helpful guidance."

The text describes information sharing and incident reporting standards, not a specific code implementation. To write code, I need a much clearer definition of the problem you want to solve. For example, do you want code to: 1. **Parse and process incident reports** conforming to RFC 3067 or RFC 5070? If so, please specify the data format (e.g., XML, JSON) and the desired output. 2. **Create a database to store incident information** based on the standards mentioned? If so, please specify the database system (e.g., SQL, NoSQL) you prefer. 3. **Automate parts of the incident response process** based on specific criteria? If so, please describe the process and the triggers for automation. 4. **Something else entirely?** Please explain your goal in more detail. Providing this information will help me understand your request and potentially provide relevant code or code snippets. Remember to consider security best practices when implementing any code related to incident response."
